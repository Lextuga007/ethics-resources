## UK Clinical Ethics Network

The [UKCEN](https://www.ukcen.net/main) is a network made up of members of clinical ethics committees and clinical ethics groups, and individuals with an interest in clinical ethics.

[Must Clinical Ethics Committees involve patients or families in their meetings?](https://blogs.bmj.com/medical-ethics/2020/08/03/must-clinical-ethics-committees-involve-patients-or-families-in-their-meetings/)

> Daniel Sokol points out some ways that clinical ethics in the UK might improve. He noted the the lack of resources for such committees: members largely sit on them in a voluntary capacity, with variable training and experience. The NHS should be prepared to invest in CEC so that they are able to provide appropriate expertise and advice to clinicians. But it is a mistake to think that clinical ethics committees should become mini courtrooms, or serve as the ethics police. That has never been their role and it should not become so.
