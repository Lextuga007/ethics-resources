## Online courses

A good place to find general ethics courses is online through MOOCs[^1] such as [FutureLearn](https://www.futurelearn.com/) (which includes Open University courses), [Edx](https://www.edx.org/) and [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) amongst a few. To find more platforms, just type "MOOC" into a search engine. These platforms offer a wide range of courses, often free or with a small charge for assessment and certification on successful achievement of their assessments. 

Many of the ethics courses cover general ethics and an increasing number cover the specialised area of data (Artificial Intelligence, algorithms and data science). To search for specific medical ethics courses the terms to look for are often bioethics and medical ethics but it's often useful to just search for the broader terms such as ethics or morality in case the courses are named differently.

## Further education

A number of UK universities offer medical ethics courses at a masters level, often combined with law. General search sites like [PostGraduateSearch](https://www.postgraduatesearch.com/pgs/search?course=medical-ethics&qualification=masters) can be useful to find these courses and note that this covers the UK. To search for Europe-wide or global courses searching for key words like "medical ethics masters europe" can help locate similar sites.

Kings College London appears to be the only University in the UK that offers a particular [Mental Health Ethics and Law MSc](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/taught-courses/mental-health-ethics-and-law-msc).

Pre-requisites for many of the courses are in relevant disciplines (e.g. law, medicine, philosophy, psychology, theology, social science, one of the life sciences, or nursing studies) or a  qualification appropriate to the programme in medicine; or a professional mental health qualification. It is always best to check these or contact the course leader if you have any questions.
