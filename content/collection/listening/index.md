Podcasts can be an interesting source of ethics information and a couple of BBC podcasts may be of interest:

### Inside the Ethics Committee

A [radio 4 programme](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007xbtd) that covers ethical dilemmas, with discussion and a conclusion as to how the scenario ended. In many ethical committees it isn't always known how things end and sometimes the cases end differently to how the ethics committee expected. 

### Bad People

A [BBC Sounds podcast](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08lj2sz) that explores criminal cases in the context of psychology, reflecting on how we have cultural differences in how we perceive "badness" and the difficult circumstances many of those who committed these crimes (as well as the victims) have been in. 

Psychology and ethics often overlap and a particular podcast to consider listening to is [No Angel: When is spreading infectious diseases a crime?](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p09ccfct) which not only reflects upon the case where HIV was spread but also the discussions that have come from the Covid-19 pandemic.
