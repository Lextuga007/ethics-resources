## AphA Ethics Group

[AphA Ethics Group](https://www.aphanalysts.org/apha-events-and-training/) for AphA members and (on approval) non-members. This is an informal Socratic method discussion group where topics like 'Do the words “Diversity” and “inclusion” imply charity from a position of power and superiority', and a broader discussion around how data can 'harm' analysts. 

Currently meets bi-monthly.

## ONS Data Science Campus

[ONS Data Science Campus]((https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/)) host an Ethics Group which is open to all members of Government, including NHS staff. Details are posted in the [Slack group](govdatascience.slack.com) which is a restricted Slack group based on email address. Only NHS.net can access this without any admin approval as not every Trust organisation is listed. There are a couple of channels where reading groups are promoted: # ethics and # community_of_interest.

The [GitHub site](https://datasciencecampus.github.io/ethics_society_reading_group/) has previous and upcoming reading information.
