  Ethics Committee Resources
---

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
This site is a collection of resources on medical and data ethics resources, primarily to support the Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust Ethics Committee, but is available to anyone who is interested. The fields of medical and data ethics may not, at first glance, appear closely related, but both have an impact on patients. In a venn diagram of medical ethics and data ethics there is central part where this site can be found.

The design of the website is from a [Hugo Ap√©ro template](https://github.com/hugo-apero/iyo-apero) created by [Alison Hill](https://twitter.com/apreshill) and hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). The images are botanical pictures of medicinal plants from Science History Institute, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons and EN NOIR & BLANC, CC0, via Wikimedia Commons.

Thanks also to both [Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust's](https://www.nottinghamshirehealthcare.nhs.uk/) and [Nottingham University Hospitals's](https://www.nuh.nhs.uk/) Ethics Committees.
